<h1 align="center">MapEditorReborn Community Guide</h1>

## Purpose of this Guide

This guide is intended to explain the purpose and basic use cases of the MapEditorReborn plugin.

MapEditorReborn is a tool designed for editing and customizing in-game maps in SCP: Secret Laboratory. It allows server administrators and map creators to place, move, rotate, and delete schematics—custom-made structures or objects—within the game environment.

The goal of this guide is to provide a clear understanding of what the plugin does, who it is for, and how it contributes to map customization and server creativity. It is not a technical manual, but rather an overview of the plugin's role in enhancing the gameplay experience.
